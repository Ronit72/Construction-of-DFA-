# Construction-of-DFA-

Algorithm

● For every input string we are checking the transition of the first character of input string
from starting state and we will store that transition state where first character transitioned
to and for next character from we will check from the stored transition state where it will
transition next,Similarly we will do for all characters until the is not over and last we will
check if the last state is final state or not if it is the final state then string will be accepted
otherwise rejected.

● In the dfa to accept strings of As and Bs having even A and odd B there are 4 states and
each and every state has 2 choices and according to the transition the dfa proceeds.

● In the dfa to accept decimal strings divisible by 3 there are 4 states and each and every
state has 4 choices and according to the transition the dfa proceeds.
